Hi Ma’am,
As discussed earlier, I’ve reviewed everything with my family and taken a final decision to proceed with my resignation.
This decision is not based on any external offer. I’m stepping out to take a planned break to recalibrate my skills and career direction.
I’m ready to follow the company exit process and serve the applicable notice period as per policy.
Kindly let me know the next steps and the confirmed notice period duration.

“I’ve discussed this with my family and taken a final decision.

This is not about this company or an offer.
I’m not continuing anywhere right now, and I’m clear about leaving.”
