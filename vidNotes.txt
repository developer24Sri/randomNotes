What the <video> tag does NOT provide:

While the <video> tag does handle basic video playback, it doesn‚Äôt come with advanced features like:
i)Custom UI: If you want a custom video player interface (buttons, progress bars, etc.), you would need to build that yourself or use a library like Video.js.
ii)Adaptive Streaming: For features like HLS or DASH streaming (adaptive bitrate streaming), the native <video> tag doesn't offer built-in support; you'd use iii)libraries like Video.js or Shaka Player to handle this.
iv)Advanced Features: Things like subtitles, annotations, analytics, etc., would require extra code or plugins.

What is HLS.js?
i)HLS.js is a JavaScript library that allows playing HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) videos in browsers that don‚Äôt natively support HLS, especially Chrome, Firefox, and Edge on desktop.
ii)HLS is natively supported only in Safari (on macOS/iOS).
iii)HLS.js brings that support to other browsers using the HTML5 <video> tag + JavaScript.

Use HLS.js when:
i)You want to stream .m3u8 files (e.g., live streams or adaptive bitrate video).
ii)You're building your own video player UI.
iii)You want more control over buffering, events, and streaming logic.

Connecting the Dots Between These APIs and Video.js:
MSE: Allows Video.js to handle adaptive streaming (HLS, DASH) for dynamic video content.

Web Audio API: Video.js can enhance the audio experience (volume control, equalization) and even visualize the audio waveform or frequency spectrum.

Media Recorder API: You can use Video.js with Media Recorder to record videos during playback, adding custom recording features to your player.

WebRTC: While not directly related to Video.js, WebRTC can be used in video conferencing or peer-to-peer streaming alongside a Video.js-based interface.

HTML5: Video.js builds on the HTML5 <video> tag, enhancing it with custom controls, plugins, and more.

Canvas API: Video.js can leverage the Canvas API to draw custom graphics or visualizations on top of the video, such as displaying a waveform or dynamic effects.

Features:
1. Customizable Controls
Feature: Video.js provides a customizable UI for the video player, where you can control which buttons and features appear in the player controls.
Sub-Components:
i)Play/Pause Button: Allows the user to play or pause the video. This button is typically visible when the video is ready to play.
Example: <button class="vjs-play-control">Play/Pause</button>
ii)Volume Control: Lets users adjust the volume of the video.
Example: <input type="range" class="vjs-volume-control" min="0" max="1" step="0.1">
iii)Progress Bar: A visual bar that shows the current playback progress.
Example: <div class="vjs-progress-control">
iv)Fullscreen Toggle: A button to toggle fullscreen mode for video playback.
Example: <button class="vjs-fullscreen-control">Fullscreen</button>
v)Playback Speed Control: A dropdown to allow users to change playback speed.
vi)Subtitle/Closed Caption Button: This button allows toggling of subtitles or captions during playback.
Example: <button class="vjs-captions-button">Subtitles</button>

2. Responsive Design
Feature: Video.js supports responsive video playback, automatically resizing based on the container and screen size.
Sub-Components:
i)vjs-fluid: Ensures the video player resizes while maintaining the aspect ratio.
Class: .vjs-fluid
ii)vjs-responsive: Makes the video player responsive, adjusting to the width of its container.
Class: .vjs-responsive
iii)vjs-fill: Ensures the video player fills the container‚Äôs width or height based on the available space.
Class: .vjs-fill
iv)Aspect Ratio Maintainer: Maintains a consistent aspect ratio, even when resizing the player.
Class: .vjs-aspect-ratio

3. Support for Adaptive Streaming (HLS, DASH)
Feature: Video.js supports adaptive streaming for formats like HLS and DASH, adjusting video quality based on network conditions.

Sub-Components:
i)HLS Plugin: Allows the video player to handle HLS streams.
Class: N/A (Plugin functionality)
ii)DASH Plugin: Handles Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH).
Class: N/A (Plugin functionality)
iii)Buffering Indicator: Shows buffering state when waiting for video segments.
Class: .vjs-loading-spinner

4. Plugin Support
